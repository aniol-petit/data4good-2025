## Data4Good 2025 — Holocaust Journeys Explorer

This project uses data from the Arolsen Archives to help people understand the histories of individuals persecuted during the Holocaust. It presents an interactive map of camps and, for a selected camp, shows a representative person’s route across locations and a short narrative of their life generated from available records.

What you can do here:
- Explore a map of camps and their relative counts.
- Select a camp to see a representative victim’s journey rendered as a route.
- Read a concise, respectfully generated story based on the person’s recorded attributes and movements.

To try it locally (with the required datasets present), run:
```bash
streamlit run app.py
```
